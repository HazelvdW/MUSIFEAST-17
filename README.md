**Introducing MUSIFEAST-17**; a music stimulus set with accompanying normative data featuring _356 instrumental 30-second clips_ from commercially released music across _17 genres_.

MUSIFEAST-17 aims to increase ecological validity of studies tailored for UK and US listeners and is designed to reflect the diversity of everyday Western musical experiences, including art music, popular music, and music composed for media.

MUSIFEAST-17's normative data is generated from 701 UK and US participants, sampled evenly across adulthood (ages 18-75), including ratings of familiarity, enjoyment, emotional expression, perceived contrast, genre recognition, as well as thought types and contextual associations evoked by each excerpt.

_This repository includes a Shiny.app as a fun visualisation tool using Plotly to listen to the stimulus set and play around with different normative data dimensions! Try it out under 'app.R' above._

This resource enables targeted and nuanced stimuli selection for diverse applications within psychology; researchers can make use of its dimensions both independently (e.g., focusing solely on emotional expression, selecting stimuli from specific valence and arousal quadrants) or in combination with other dimensions (e.g., genre recognition and contextual associations).

Independantly, Tuomas Eerola extracted audio features for MUSIFEAST-17 dataset with MIR Toolbox. You can access, view, and download the full feature set and a reduced 33-feature set from [Tuomas Eerola's GitHub: MUSIFEAST17-audio](https://github.com/tuomaseerola/MUSIFEAST17-audio), and a reader-friendly version with more visualisations [here](https://tuomaseerola.github.io/MUSIFEAST17-audio/MUSIFEST17_audio_features.html).
