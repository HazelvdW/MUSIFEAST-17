Introducing MUSIFEAST-17; a music stimulus set featuring 356 instrumental 30-second clips from commercially released music across 17 genres. 
Designed to reflect the diversity of everyday UK/US musical experiences, MUSIFEAST-17 includes art music, popular music, and music composed for media over a range of expected familiarity,
aiming to increase ecological validity of studies tailored for UK and US listeners. 
MUSIFEAST-17 includes normative data from 701 UK and US participants, sampled evenly across adulthood (ages 18-75), 
on familiarity, enjoyment, emotional expression, perceived contrast, genre recognition, thought types, and contextual associations evoked by each excerpt. 
This resource enables systematic stimuli selection for diverse applications within psychology (e.g., emotion studies, aesthetic experience, music-evoked imaginings) and supports Open Science practices.

All music stimuli, normative data tables, and supplementary materials can also be accessed via the MUSIFEAST-17 repository on OSF, https://osf.io/5ebz2
