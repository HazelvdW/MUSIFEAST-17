Introducing MUSIFEAST-17; a music stimulus set featuring 356 instrumental 30-second clips 
from commercially released music across 17 genres, aiming to increase ecological validity 
of studies tailored for UK and US listeners. Designed to reflect the diversity of everyday 
UK/US musical experiences, MUSIFEAST-17 includes art music, popular music, and music 
composed for media. MUSIFEAST-17 includes normative data from 701 UK and US participants, 
sampled evenly across adulthood (ages 18-75), on familiarity, enjoyment, emotional expression, 
perceived contrast, genre recognition, thought types, and contextual associations evoked by each excerpt.
This resource enables systematic stimuli selection for diverse applications within psychology 
(e.g., emotion studies, aesthetic experience, music-evoked imaginings) and supports Open Science practices.
